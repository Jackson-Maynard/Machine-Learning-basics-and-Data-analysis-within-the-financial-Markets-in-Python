    "## The basics of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreted vs. compiled languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language. This means that when you write code in Python it isn't compiled before runtime to machine code for execution. Instead an interpreter executed the language during runtime. It can be more easier run on multiple platforms. Languages like C are compiled languages and need to compiled for each platform they run on. Typically, compiled languages will be quicker to execute. \n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of interpreted languages is they don't do static type-checking, which can help pick up programming errors before runtime. In newer versions of Python though, you can do type annotations on your variables. At this stage the actual Python interpreter won't enforce static type checking. Hence, to do static type checking of these type annotations you need to use an IDE like PyCharm or run a type checker like mypy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imperative vs. functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is predominently an imperative programming language, like most common programming langauges such as C. A series of introductions are executed in a specific order which updates the internal state of the program. Typically, you have code organised into loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also includes some elements of functional programming. In functional programming languages you break down a problem in a number of functions. You don't keep track of the internal state. Functions are called in recursive manner. Haskell and Lisp are examples of well known functional languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the current version of Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version of Python is 3 (the latest version is 3.7). We would strongly recommend using Python 3 where possible. However, there are still a lot of developers using the older Python 2 (latest version is 2.7), mainly because they have a lot of legacy code written in Python 2, which hasn't yet been migrated to 3. The differences between 2 and 3 aren't huge, but generally speaking it isn't an automatic process to migrate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code isn't the fastest to execute. Furthermore it isn't the most widely used language. Lower level languages like C++ (and also Java) have historically been used much more and are also much faster. However, Python does excel at being a relatively easy to use language. When we factor in how fast code can execute, we also need to understand how long it will take to write. Python has become much more popular in recent years (see https://hackernoon.com/top-3-most-popular-programming-languages-in-2018-and-their-annual-salaries-51b4a7354e06).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who uses Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general purpose language, hence it can be used in many different domains (see https://www.python.org/about/apps/), such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* web development\n",
    "* desktop GUIs\n",
    "* business applications\n",
    "* data science \n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus in this course is using Python to solve data science problems specifically in the financial domain. Historically, Matlab has been a popular lanaguage for data science problems. In recent years, many Matlab users have migrated to Python and R. One major explanation for this shift is because both Python and R are open source. R is geared towards statistical computing, and has many packages related to statistcal methods. It is less of a general purpose language compared to Python. Python has also caught up with support for statistical methods and in some cases has overtaken R, in particular when it comes to cutting edge machine learning libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python use cases for financial firms?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many use cases for Python for financial firms, below we have mentioned a small number of these. We'll go through many of these later in the course and show some demos too. Can you think of any further use cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automating processes to replace heavily manual Excel processes\n",
    "    * Downloading market data\n",
    "    * Creating reports and e-mailing them\n",
    "* Risk management calculations\n",
    "* Option pricing\n",
    "* Trading strategy backtests\n",
    "* Web dashboards to display and process market data\n",
    "* Creating fun visualisations of financial markets\n",
    "* Doing transaction cost analysis\n",
    "* Crunch alternative data sources like text and images\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can work with Excel and C/C++, so it can work with existing libraries and resources you might already have like trader spreadsheets or C/C++ option pricing libraries."

    "## What are the Python distributions?\n",
    "As well as there being different Python versions, there are also many different distributions of Python too. Anaconda is a type of Python distribution. The main reference Python distribution is CPython (https://www.python.org). It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of other distributions and only has skeleton set of tools in it. It includes pip for installing additional Python libraries, which you are likely to need.\n",
    " \n",
    "PyPy (https://pypy.org/) is a replacement for the CPython interpreter. It uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to increase the speed of execution. If you have purely Python code, it can work very well. However, many Python libraries also interact with C code underneath, and not all of these will be compatible with PyPy. NumPy, which is an important scientific library is now on PyPy's compatible list. However, it might be the case that some of the libraries you use won't be.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also Jython (https://www.jython.org/) which runs Python code on the Java virtual machine, making it easy to interact with other code also on the JVM. IronPython (https://ironpython.net/) is similar but integrates with Microsoft's .NET Framework. In both cases, however, they might not support all the Python libraries you need. Currently, both Jython and IronPython also don't have Python 3 implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda: Python distribution for data analysis\n",
    "Anaconda is a Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com) that is designed for scientific computing and I typically tend to use this. It already has important data science packages like NumPy and pandas already installed, saving you from having to do so yourself. It also includes the conda package and virtual environment manager. The main disadvantage is that the file size of the distribution can be very large. In general I would recommend using Anaconda for most data science work, as it can simplify the installation of Python packages. In a separate notebook, there are details on how to install the required environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### conda and pip to install new packages\n",
    "We noted that CPython includes pip for installing new Python packages to your local Python distribution. These can be Python packages fetched from PyPI (https://pypi.org/) or ones which have been manually downloaded. Say we want to install the pandas library, we would simply run the following in the command prompt. pip can also be used to remove or update existing installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also specify the version of the library we want to install. Very often we need to be careful which versions of libraries we install. Over time, their APIs can change and break existing code which depends on them. For example, with pandas, the syntax for quite a few of the calls has changed over the years. We can either update our code so it works with newer versions of pandas, or try to support multiple versions of pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install pandas==1.2.3\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda also includes conda which can be used to install new Python packages (most will be installable via conda, although some can only use pip). Unlike pip it will check what other packages have been installed in the current Python environment, and it will try to figure out how to install the compatible dependencies. pip will instead just install whatever dependencies you have even if they break existing libraries. Anaconda Navigator is a graphical tool to help manage your various conda pacakges. From the command line conda can be used as follows (note, conda uses = as opposed to == with pip).\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install pandas=1.2.3\n",
    "\n",
    "conda can also be used to manage virtual environments. You may want to have several different Python environments running on the same machines, with different versions of Python and also different packages installed on them. You can think of these virtual environments as sandboxes too, so you can experiment with them, without breaking your main Python environment. The below will create a new conda environment called \"py38class\" of Python 3.8 on your computer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python gives you a lot of freedom in how you write your code. However, in general, it is a good idea to be relatively consistent in how you code. If you are working in a team, it is also important that everyone uses the same conventions to make the code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PEP8 Python style guide by Guido van Rossum, who invented the Python language, defines a number of different coding conventions, which it is recommended that you follow, to make your code easier to read and understand. Here we go through some of the main things flagged in the style guide. It is recommended you also go through it in full at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. Source code editors in IDEs will often flag if your code doesn't adhere to some elements of the PEP8 standard. It's also worth going on GitHub, to see how some popular libraries are written, eg. pandas or NumPy to give you an idea of the types of conventions used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentations\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentations in your Python code should be 4 spaces and be consistent. Code might still run if you are not fully consistent, but it makes it difficult to read in any case. On the question of tabs or spaces, do not mix them. Only use tabs if they are already used in the code. Python 3 doesn't allow the mixing of tabs and spaces as well."

    "Very often we might wish to run multiple tasks in parallel, because it's much quicker! However, it can cause complications, particularly if we are reading/writing to the same variables. It can result in some very subtle bugs which are difficult to find. In this instance, we need to be careful to look shared variables, so only one thread can read/write to it in any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your operation is \"embarrassingly parallel\" and doesn't require the reading/writing to shared memory it is much easier. This could for example involve reading from many different webpages or generating many Monte Carlo paths indepedently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has the GIL, global interpreter lock, which means that at any particular time only one operation can be executed. `threading` (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) and `asyncio` modules allow us to kick off concurrent code, but it should be noted, they will only be useful for IO bound operations (as in practice they don't actually allow execution of more than one instruction at the same time). IO bound operations are things like reading/writing from disk or fetching webpages. Most of the time here is spent waiting for the IO operation to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "By constrast, heavy number crunching is more limited by the CPU, rather than IO considerations. If we want to parallelise CPU bound operations, we should use a library like `multiprocessing` (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html). Given that `multiprocessing` actually kicks off different Python instances to do the computation, underneath it uses `pickle` to serialize/deserialize objects to send them back and forth between the various processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also third party libraries that are worth looking at such as `multiprocess` and `pathos`, which use `dill` for pickling rather than `pickle` and are a bit more flexible. In all these instances, there's obviously quite a bit of overhead when doing the serialisation/deserialisation, hence, we should try to limit the amount of data which goes back and forth and interprocess communicaiton.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall now do a demo comparing `threading` vs `multiprocessing`. We shall use `concurrent.futures` library (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) which is an abstraction on top of `threading` and `multiprocessing`. Note, that we shall run this script separately, as the `multiprocessing` library does not work when using Python interactively in Windows (it should work in Linux) - although the code is below for your reference. We shall examine how these various libraries can be used to speed up the downloading of webpages.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before doing this, it's worth trying to install Anaconda and PyCharm (see separate notebook with full instructions) and all the other Python libraries you'll need for this Python course. Alternatively, do this for the next class and just use https://repl.it/languages/python3 for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get familar with various code editors\n",
    "\n",

    "### Variables and basic operators\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create integer, float and string variables and check their types \n",
    "* What does 3 > 2 evaluate to?\n",
    "* What does 3 > 3 evaluate to?\n",
    "* Multiply 10 by 10 and print output\n",
    "* Concatenate two strings together and print output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with lists\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a list of numbers from 1-5\n",
    "* Add an element on the end\n",
    "* Remove the first element\n",
    "* Remove the last element\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a dictionary consisting of a surnames as keys, and first names as values for members of The Beatles\n",
    "* Print all the keys\n",
    "* Print all the values\n",
    "* Try looking up some values for given keys and printing them\n",
